## Freshmen and Sophomores

Usually in freshman and sophomore year students explore their interests and take general courses to get familiar with the fields here. 

But…

If you have already decided that you are going to CS or you want a future job requiring CS than in my opinion you better focus only on CS courses. Some fundamental courses like data structures, algorithms and discrete math are essential and I highly recommend to study them meticulously - all other courses will be built on top of these fundamental courses. Additionally tech interviews will thoroughly check your knowledge of these fundamental courses, so you have at least 2 reasons to study them.

However, the learning part of your journey lies outside of the class. It is essential for you to build on your fundamentals. 

Finding an internship in the first 2 years is going to be very hard, I have to admit. It is because companies are usually looking for people who are in junior or senior year as they can be converted to full-time employees right after graduation. Some companies don’t explicitly state these requirements, so if you were rejected, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are not capable - it merely means that you have to wait till your junior year. However, in my opinion you still better apply to companies, so you can gather a lot of experience and you will be more than ready for your junior year - the period when companies are more likely to take you as an intern.

Some internship programs and scholarships are specifically aimed at freshmen and sophomores so you have to search for them. Usually they are hidden under usual job openings or need you to go to different sites, but applying to them is worth it. 

Here are some that I can get of top:

Also you can apply to CuOP program, which is a partnership between university and companies, where you 

## Junior and Senior

I consider junior year to be a golden period as you have still one year to graduate which means companies are more likely to accept you. Also, by this time you are likely to be experienced in CS, compared to your freshman and sophomore years.
