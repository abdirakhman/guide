title: 'Application Process'
---

The slogan that I go with during job hunting is - **START EARLY**.

For example the application period for summer internships in foreign tech companies can start **as early as September** and usually lasts 3-4 months. It also can depend on the company, but usually most tech companies are taking around this period. I would recommend monitoring internship postings since the start of Fall semester, and usually there are threads or lists of internship positions [like this](https://github.com/elaine-zheng/summer2020internships) which are being updated by people, so your life gets easier in this regard. 

If you consider internships in Korean companies though, the application period is more loose, as they can accept applications 1-2 month(s) earlier than the start of the internship.

Now let’s consider how application process goes:

## Writing resume

Resume is the most important part of your  application for the job. It may be daunting to write a resume your first time, since you don’t know what to talk about, however it gets only better with time and experience. 

One of my advices regarding this, would be to gain feedback from someone before finalizing your resume. Grab your friend or roommate and make one proofread your resume. It is necessary because your screening can't just slip on minor mistakes or misspellings. You can also join CS communities / groups in order to get your resume checked. Multiple perspectives' from community on your resume can give you a lot of insights on how to improve it.

There are a lot of posts in the internet for writing your resume so I decided to just only put some links and life hacks related to resume writing.

- [Resume tips](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10b9NZDhPbUOW_C7108IKe9ev6Ed2UG7F/view) - comprehensive guide on how to write a resume. Must read.
- **Tip:** - Try to make a master resume - a resume which contains everything that you wanted to list in your resume. It is ok to send one resume to all the companies, that you apply to. However, it is better to tailor your resume to the role, so that you will have better chances to be seemed as a suitable candidate. Here, master resume kicks in, as you can just copy it and delete unnecessary parts to fit to the company profile rather than rewriting your one resume a lot of times. 
- **Tip:** - Usually you will have a lot of iterations of your resume it makes sense to do some version control on them. For example: you can do put timestamp on your resume so that you won't accidentally send old resume. For example: `CV-2020-06-01.pdf`

## Filling in forms

Usually job applications are just a bunch of online forms that you have to fill in. It is an incredibly boring and tedious process. ( People even made some automation tools for filling in these forms ) 

**Filling my LinkedIn profile has helped me immensely during application to job positions.** The thing is that, usually most forms allow you just to import all the information from LinkedIn, and it is such a game changer, especially when you have to apply to a lot of companies. 

## It is a numbers game

Let’s talk about something not very uncomfortable: you are going to be rejected. A lot. From my personal experience - in my junior year I have applied to **60+** companies and have heard back only from about **5** of them and got offers only from **3**. You might say that it is overkill, but it is a harsh reality of the job market. However, this story got a Happy Ending - from these 3 offers, one was from Google. I was on cloud nine and couldn’t believe that I got an internship, even though I got rejected and ghosted countless times. By the time I applied to this position I was a bit hopeless, but still applied thinking that maybe it might be the chance. As people say: “You miss 100% of shots that you don’t take”, so even if you are feeling that you don’t have odds, it is still worth it to apply. **You virtually don’t lose anything at all by applying to the job of your dream.**
