title: 'Application Process'
---

The slogan that I go with during job hunting is - START EARLY.

For example the application period for summer internships in foreign tech companies can start as early as September and usually lasts 3-4 months. It also can depend on the company, but usually most tech companies are taking around this perioв. I would recommend monitoring internship postings since the start of Fall semester, and usually there are threads or lists of internship positions (like this) which are being updated by people, so your life gets easier in this regard. 

If you consider internships in Korean companies though, the application period is more loose, as they can accept applications 1-2 month(s) earlier than the start of the internship.

Now let’s consider how application process goes:

## Resume (and maybe Cover Letter)

Resume is the most important part of your  application for the job. It may be daunting to write a resume your first time, since you don’t know what to talk about, however it gets only better with time and experience. 

Writing resumes is a big topic, maybe make a separate post?

## Filling in forms

Usually job applications are just a bunch of online forms that you have to fill in. It is an incredibly boring and tedious process. ( People even made some automation tools for filling in these forms ) 

Filling my LinkedIn profile has helped me immensely during application to job positions. The thing is that, usually most forms allow you just to import all the information from LinkedIn, and it is such a game changed especially when you have to apply to a lot of companies. 

## It is a numbers game

Let’s talk about something not very uncomfortable: you are going to be rejected. A lot. From my personal experience - in my junior year I have applied to 60+ companies and have heard back only from about 5 of them and got offers only from 3. You might say that it is overkill, but it is a harsh reality of the job market. However, this story got a Happy Ending - from these 3 offers, one was from Google. I was on cloud nine and couldn’t believe that I got an internship, even though I got rejected and ghosted countless times. By the time I applied to this position I was a bit hopeless, but still applied thinking that maybe it might be the chance. As people say: “You miss 100% of shots that you don’t take”, so even if you are feeling that you don’t have odds, it is still worth it to apply. You virtually don’t lose anything at all by applying to the job you wish.
