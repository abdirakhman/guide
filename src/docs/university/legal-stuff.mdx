If you don’t have citizenship of Korea, it is likely that you require a work permit for doing an internship. However it is also possible for you to intern without explicitly enrolling. 
	
## Freelance contract
You can sign with a company freelance contract, which means that in legal terms you are going to be a freelancer for them. In reality it isn’t going to change much of your internship, except the stuff that maybe 
Most likely you are having a D-2 visa for study. It means that you are restricted in many ways to work inside Korea, even part-time. As internship is a full-time paid job you two options:

## Obtaining work permit

### Without changing visa
Obtain a work permit as a student - ISSS have made a guideline for this process. It is likely that you will be going back and forth collecting documents and taking signatures. Please make sure to constantly update your recruiter on your progress. University needs several documents from the company such as - business certificates, information about internship, contacts of your future supervisor in the company. It is good advice to warn your recruiter about this right after you get the list of needed documents. 

After you get all the approvals and documents you have to go to the immigration center where you have to submit them. If you have collected all the needed documents, usually it takes not so much time to print the work permit in your passport. However, they can also ask for additional information, so again make sure you have contacts of your company and university officials, so that you can answer immigrations officers on the spot.  

### With changing visa (rare)
Change visa type in order to be able to work - it is a bit more difficult way to do an internship - if you are returning from internship back to studying you have to again change the visa type. I think this option is only suitable for if you want to intern in Korea for a long period, like 6 months or more. It is because, if you are working then you have to take a leave of absence. However, as an international if you are taking leave of absence then you have to leave Korea, so usually long internships are not very feasible for internationals down here.
