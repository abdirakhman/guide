# What to do?
So the first question that may araise when you want to get into the company is: "How to increase my odds?". Here I have compiled a list of activities that will increase your odds in one way or another.

## Networking
There is a reason I have listed networking first. The premise that only hard work is going to 
guarantee you success is only a half-truth. As in real life when it is easier to get new friends via friends, it is also easier to get a good opportunities in tech industry if a lot of people know you.

If you are seeking for a job, your friends/acquitances who work at companies can refer you to their HRs, who definitely are going to review your application more attentively. Referrals is a win-win strategy for everyone involved and for sure a huge advantage especially if the company is big like Google or Facebook, that get a tremendous number of applications every year.

Although, it is rumoured that engineering jobs are for people who don't like to talk, I assure you that it is not the case. Communication is one of the most important skills at your work. Therefore I think that you should go out and meet people in order to develop this skill and grow your network, in order to be successful. 

## Projects
A good way to show that you have skills required for the job is to do projects. And in my opinion doing projects is the most fun way to grow professionally! You and only you decide what you want to do for a project and it is very exciting to build something by yourself. It doesn't need to be something extraordinary or original, what matters is your enjoyment out of the process.

Projects are also an excellent opportunity to put your skills under a test. I have learned many software engineering concepts, while doing my projects, as I had to go through complete lifecycle of the development - from the system design to deployment. I have to say that it is also satisfyign to apply your theoretical knowledge gained from CS classes for implementing a useful software apps. 

## Open source contributions
Have you ever thought that you need some not implemented feature in the software that you are using? In case of open-source software (OSS), you can actually directly participate in the development of the product. Literally anyone can leave a mark on well renowned projects, and it will be shown to everyone that you have made a contribution. 

Although it might look intimidating at first, open source community is very welcoming and always accept new members. You can start out your journey with a thing as simple as updating documentation and slowly get hang of the process. 

There is even a student program - [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) which is in a couple of words is an internship for an open-source project.
It is a great opportunity to both have an internship and contribute to some cool projects. 

## Research
It is no surprise that KAIST has a lot of research opportunities, even for undergraduate students. The quality of research produced here is top-notch and who knows maybe the lab that you will join, may produce some cutting edge technology or release a great paper. Besides  if you establish good communication with professors, they can be excellent mentors. 

## Participation in events
Hackathons and workshops provide excellent opportunities to network and do some cool projects. 
Usually hackathons last 1-2 days and during this timespan, you and your team have to develop some application that adheres to the theme of competition. Hackathons provide a lot of resources to their particpants starting from food to hardware for your projects. Companies as well are interested in hackathons, and may come as speaker/mentor to these events.

It's a bit hard to tell what kind of amazing experience the hackathons are so I think it's better to view [past hackathons](https://mlh.io/seasons/2021/events) to get a grasp of them.
