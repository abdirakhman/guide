So the first question that may araise when you want to get into the company is: "How to increase my odds?". Here I have compiled a list of activities that will probably increase your odds.

## Networking
There is a reason I have listed networking first. 

## Projects
Pet projects

## Research
Some professors here at KAIST can take you as an intern to their labs. 

## Participation in events
Hackathons and workshops.

## Leadership
Organize the event.
