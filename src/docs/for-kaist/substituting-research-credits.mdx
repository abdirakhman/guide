title: 'Substituting research credits'
---

KAIST requires students to complete 3 Research Credits. It means that you have to participate in some research program and usually students choose Individual Study to close these requirements in order to graduate. However, you can also complete these requirements by doing an internship, which in my opinion is a huge plus. In order to recognize the credits you have to fill some forms and talk with a professor who is in charge of internships from your department.
