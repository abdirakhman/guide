# CS Job Hunting Guide for students

Welcome to the community-based guide/wiki for students interested in tech careers!

This project is an ordered list of articles that can help people who want to land a good tech job and grow professionally. Although it is specifically targeted to students from KAIST, most of the articles here can be generalized easily to anybody. It is also worth saying that this project is fueled purely on enthusiasm and ramen noodles. 

Furthermore, as this site is open-source, we are welcome to any contributions towards this project!
